# Setup

Hello team, I have succesfully migrated your code to React.js and we can start working on the next sprint. Below I am writing some notes for you to get started with.

### Installation
- Install Node.js on your laptop, on vs code install any snippet extension you would like for easy code writing. and Prettier for code formatting.

## After git pull & branch change
- once you have pulled the branch go in the client folder.
--  npm install 
--  npm run dev
- Execute the above to commands. npm install is used to download bootstrap and etc. while npm run dev is used to run the react app on a server.
